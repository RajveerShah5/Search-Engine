## 🚀 Key Features

- **⚙️ Scalable Indexing Architecture**  
  Emulates distributed indexing using techniques inspired by **MapReduce**, supporting efficient document processing.

- **📊 Relevance Ranking**  
  Integrates **TF-IDF** and **PageRank**-like strategies to rank search results by importance and context.

- **🛠️ REST API Interface**  
  Designed RESTful endpoints to handle user queries and return ranked document results.

- **🖥️ Conceptual Front-End**  
  Simulated user interface to demonstrate how search results would be presented in a typical search engine.

## 🎯 Project Scope  
Completed as part of a university-level course in **Large-Scale Information Retrieval**, this project aimed to:

- Apply theoretical knowledge of inverted indexing and search engine architecture.
- Simulate a scalable search pipeline using distributed systems concepts.
- Understand and implement ranking algorithms based on **term frequency**, **inverse document frequency**, and **graph-based importance**.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Gained experience building and querying large-scale inverted indexes.
- Developed RESTful search services simulating real-world search engine behavior.
- Applied ranking algorithms to improve relevance and accuracy of results.
- Practiced modular backend design and conceptual UI integration.
